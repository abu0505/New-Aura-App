Changes:
- Added beforeunload window listener to prevent accidental page closes/refreshes during web uploads.
- Increased JS/browser parallel video upload chunk limit from 4 to 5.
- Reduced default video upload chunk size from 5MB to 1MB to avoid native bridge payload limits.
- Rewrote BackgroundUploadPlugin to enqueue chunks one-by-one, avoiding 1MB Android IPC Binder crashes.
